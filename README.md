## Introduction
Small alteration in the code from https://github.com/marcobb8/tr_bn to extract the structure of the tractable bayesian network at different desired treewidth in the form of a matrix text. This text can be later fed to bnlearn or genie to perform parameter learning and further likelihood estimations as desired.
